# FreekiWebsite Clone

This project is a comprehensive clone of the [FreekiWebsite](https://www.freekiwebsite.com/) website, built from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS. It aims to replicate the design, functionality, and user experience of the original site, including its modern all-black theme and dynamic navigation.

## Features

- **Complete Website Clone:** All major pages from the original FreekiWebsite site are included: Home, Services, Industries, Clients, About, Insights, and Contact.
- **Modern All-Black Theme:** A sleek and professional all-black design has been implemented across the entire website, providing a consistent and visually appealing user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Dynamic Navigation:** The navigation bar is initially transparent, becomes solid on scroll, and hides/appears based on scroll direction for an enhanced UX.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with a clean and modular component structure in React, making the codebase easy to maintain and scale.
- **Custom Tailwind CSS Theme:** The project uses a custom Tailwind CSS configuration with a specific color palette, font styles, and animations to match the FreekiWebsite branding.
- **Routing with React Router:** All page navigation is handled by `react-router-dom`, ensuring a seamless single-page application experience.
- **Netlify Ready:** The project includes a `netlify.toml` file with the necessary build configurations and redirects for easy deployment on Netlify.
- **Detailed README:** This `README.md` provides comprehensive instructions for installation, development, and deployment.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Teju2025/Development-website-.git
   cd Development-website-
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles the app into static files for production and places them in the `build` directory. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Netlify Deployment

1. **Push your code to a GitHub repository.**
2. **Log in to Netlify** and select "New site from Git."
3. **Choose your Git provider** (e.g., GitHub) and select the repository.
4. **Configure the build settings:**
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `build`
5. **Click "Deploy site."**

Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site. The `netlify.toml` file in the repository includes the necessary configurations, including a redirect rule to handle single-page application routing correctly.

```toml
# netlify.toml

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
  
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```
